1. Classification vs Regression
-------------------------------

Your goal is to identify students who might need early intervention - which type of supervised machine learning problem is this,
classification or regression? Why?

Identifying students who might need early intervention is a *classification* problem as you are sorting students into classes (*needs intervention*, *doesn't need intervention*) rather than trying to predict a quantitative value.

.. this is a temporary hack because sphinx won't ignore this heading in the toctree if I leave it in the exploring_data file.
